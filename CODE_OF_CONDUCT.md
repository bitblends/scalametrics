# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We want **scalametrics** to be a welcoming community. We pledge to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that helps our community:
- Being kind, respectful, and constructive.
- Giving and receiving helpful feedback.
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and community.
- Showing empathy toward other community members.

Examples of behavior that harms our community:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Discriminatory jokes or imagery.
- Trolling, flame wars, or intentionally derailing conversations.
- Publishing others’ private information without permission.
- Any other conduct that a reasonable person would consider inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking fair, consistent action when unacceptable behavior occurs. Maintainers may remove or reject contributions, and may ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem harmful.

## Scope
This Code applies within project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, code reviews, docs, chats) and when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately to the maintainers at <b>scalametrics&commat;bitblends.com</b>. You may include:
- A description of what happened
- Where it happened (issue/PR link, discussion, etc.)
- Date/time and any relevant context
- Screenshots or other evidence (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**, keep reports confidential to the extent possible, and communicate the next steps.

For urgent threats to safety, contact local authorities first.

## Enforcement
All reports will be reviewed and investigated as appropriate. When determining actions, maintainers will consider the impact on the community.

### Enforcement Guidelines
These guidelines describe how we typically respond to violations:

1. **Correction**  
   - *Impact*: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.  
   - *Outcome*: Private or public note from maintainers with guidance on expected behavior.

2. **Warning**  
   - *Impact*: A single incident or series of actions that violate this Code.  
   - *Outcome*: Formal warning; continued violations may lead to temporary or permanent restrictions.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   - *Impact*: Persistent violations after a warning, or significant harm to individuals/community.  
   - *Outcome*: Temporary removal from community spaces for a set period. Conditions for return will be specified.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   - *Impact*: Demonstrated pattern of violations, harassment, or explicit refusal to comply with the Code.  
   - *Outcome*: Permanent removal from community spaces.

## Appeals
If you believe an action was taken in error or unfairly, you may appeal by emailing <b>scalametrics&commat;bitblends.com</b> with relevant context. Another maintainer not involved in the initial decision (if available) will review.
